# Recommendation Systems using Graph Neural Networks

This repository contains the code for building a recommendation system using Graph Neural Networks(GNNs). It contains pytorch implementation of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07243). The project aims to use GNNs to create a recommendation system and learn the joint embeddings of each user and item which are part of the given graph.
